# Metrocard-Fare-Calculator
New York City (NYC) subways and buses can be paid for with a Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) Metrocard, with most rides costing $2.75 regardless of distance. However, adding fare to your reusable Metrocard grants 5% bonus fare; last checked of November 1, 2018. This quickly reslts in an inconvenient extra money on your card, if you know you'll only need the card for an exact number of trips. To attempt and get the most "bang for your buck", we attempted to design an R function which will calculate exactly how much fare you'd need to add to a fresh card in order to ensure that by the end of the number of trips you plan to make, you will have zero cents left. Really intended for tourists and occasional travelers, rather than daily or regular travelers who never stop riding and recharging their Metrocards.
